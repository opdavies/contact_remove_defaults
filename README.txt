INTRODUCTION
------------

By default, if you are logged in to a website with the Contact module enabled,
the form is pre-populated with the logged in userâ€™s name and email address.

This module removes the default values for authenticated users, so that the
fields are blank when the contact form is viewed.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * Contact module (in core)


INSTALLATION
------------
 
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for
   further information.
